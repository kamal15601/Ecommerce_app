## Overview

Our e-commerce application leverages Azure DevOps for end-to-end DevOps automation, providing:

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated building and testing of code changes
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to multiple environments
- **Security Scanning**: Detection of vulnerabilities in code and containers
- **Quality Gates**: Enforcement of code quality standards
- **Release Approvals**: Controlled promotion between environments
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of application health and performance

## Repository Structure

The application is structured in a monorepo pattern, with frontend and backend components in separate directories:

```
ecommerce-app/
├── src/
│   ├── backend/        # Flask API backend
│   └── frontend/       # React frontend
├── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure as Code
│   ├── kubernetes/     # Kubernetes manifests
│   ├── terraform/      # Terraform configurations
│   └── ansible/        # Ansible playbooks
├── cicd/
│   ├── azure-devops/   # Azure DevOps pipeline configurations
│   ├── jenkins/        # Jenkins pipeline configurations
│   └── github/         # GitHub Actions workflows

│   └── performance/    # Performance tests
└── monitoring/         # Monitoring configurations
```

## Azure DevOps Pipeline

Our Azure DevOps pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) implements a complete CI/CD workflow with the following stages:

### 1. Build Stage

- **Backend Build**: Compiles the Python backend, runs linting and unit tests
- **Frontend Build**: Builds the React frontend, runs linting and unit tests
- **Security Scan**: Scans container images for vulnerabilities using Trivy

### 2. Development Deployment

- Deploys to AKS development namespace
- Runs smoke tests to verify basic functionality
- Sets up appropriate environment variables

### 3. Integration Testing

- Runs API integration tests against the development environment
- Performs end-to-end testing of critical user journeys
- Validates data flows between components

### 4. Staging Deployment

- Deploys to AKS staging namespace with production-like configuration
- Requires approval from QA team
- Performs comprehensive health checks

### 5. Performance Testing

- Runs load tests using k6
- Validates application performance under load
- Ensures response times meet SLAs

### 6. Production Deployment

- Deploys to AKS production namespace
- Requires approval from product owner
- Uses blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime
- Configures monitoring and alerts

## Environment Setup

We maintain three distinct environments, each with its own configuration:

### Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Feature testing and development integration
- **Configuration**: Minimal resources, debug enabled
- **Data**: Test data, refreshed periodically
- **Access**: Available to all developers

### Staging Environment

- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation
- **Configuration**: Production-like settings
- **Data**: Anonymized production data
- **Access**: Limited to QA team and release managers

### Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing application
- **Configuration**: Optimized for performance and reliability
- **Data**: Real customer data
- **Access**: Highly restricted, change approval required

## Service Connections

Azure DevOps requires service connections to interact with external services. Our pipeline uses:

### Azure Container Registry Connection

- **Purpose**: Push and pull container images
- **Authentication**: Service Principal
- **Permissions**: AcrPush role

### Azure Kubernetes Service Connections

- **Development**: Connects to development AKS cluster
- **Staging**: Connects to staging AKS cluster
- **Production**: Connects to production AKS cluster
- **Authentication**: Service Principal with Kubernetes RBAC
- **Permissions**: Limited to specific namespaces

### Azure Resource Manager Connection

- **Purpose**: Manage Azure resources
- **Authentication**: Service Principal
- **Permissions**: Contributor role on resource groups

## Security and Compliance

Our Azure DevOps implementation includes several security measures:

### Code Security

- **Branch Policies**: Require code reviews and passing builds
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing with SonarQube
- **Secret Detection**: Detect secrets in code with GitLeaks

### Container Security

- **Image Scanning**: Scan for vulnerabilities with Trivy
- **Base Image Compliance**: Use approved base images only
- **Image Signing**: Sign images for authenticity verification

### Pipeline Security

- **Secure Variables**: Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
- **Least Privilege**: Use service principals with minimal permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Track all pipeline activities

## Monitoring and Alerts

After deployment, our Azure DevOps pipeline sets up:

### Application Monitoring

- **Application Insights**: Track application performance and usage
- **Log Analytics**: Centralized logging for troubleshooting
- **Availability Tests**: Regular health checks from multiple locations

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- **Azure Monitor**: Track resource utilization
- **Prometheus**: Kubernetes monitoring
- **Grafana**: Visualization of metrics

### Alerting

- **Performance Alerts**: Notify when performance degrades
- **Error Alerts**: Notify on increased error rates
- **Availability Alerts**: Notify on failed health checks

## Best Practices

Our Azure DevOps implementation follows these best practices:

### Pipeline Design

- **YAML Pipelines**: Store pipeline configuration as code
- **Templates**: Use templates for common tasks
- **Parameterization**: Make pipelines reusable across projects
- **Modular Stages**: Independent stages for better maintainability

### Deployment Strategy

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Progressive Exposure**: Gradually roll out to users
- **Automated Rollback**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Environment Parity**: Keep environments as similar as possible

### Governance

- **Approval Workflows**: Required approvals for sensitive environments
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes and deployments
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation
- **Compliance Checks**: Enforce organizational policies

## Getting Started

To set up this pipeline for your own project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create an Azure DevOps project
3. Set up the required service connections
4. Create variable groups for each environment
5. Import the pipeline from `cicd/azure-devops/azure-pipelines.yml`
6. Create the environments in Azure DevOps
7. Configure approval policies
8. Run the pipeline

## Conclusion

Our Azure DevOps integration provides a robust, secure, and automated CI/CD pipeline for the e-commerce application. By following the principles of DevOps, we ensure rapid, reliable, and safe delivery of new features to our customers.
