## Architecture Overview

This application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application
- **Backend API**: Flask-based RESTful API with Redis caching
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and data caching
- **Load Balancer/Gateway**: Nginx or Kubernetes Ingress for traffic routing

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js for UI components
- Redux for state management
- Axios for API requests
- Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests

### Backend
- Flask web framework
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Redis for caching
- Prometheus client for metrics
- Pytest for testing

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Ansible for configuration management
- Helm for Kubernetes package management

### CI/CD
- Jenkins or GitHub Actions for pipeline automation
- SonarQube for code quality

## DevOps Implementations

This project demonstrates the following DevOps practices:

### 1. Containerization with Docker
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks for reliability
- Docker Compose for local development

### 2. Orchestration with Kubernetes
- Deployment strategies (Rolling updates)
- Resource limits and requests
- Liveness and readiness probes
- ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration
- Ingress for external access

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for cloud resource provisioning
- Ansible for configuration management
- Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments

### 4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Automated testing (unit, integration)
- Code quality checks (linting, static analysis)
- Security scanning
- Automated deployments to multiple environments

### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Visualization with Grafana
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack
- Alerting and notification systems

### 6. GitOps
- Infrastructure and application configurations in Git
- Automated deployment from Git changes
- Environment promotion (dev → staging → production)

### 7. Security
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Secret management
- Least privilege principle
- Network policies and segmentation

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `infrastructure/docker` directory
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:80

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
# Start all services locally
cd infrastructure/docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
cd infrastructure/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f backend.yaml
kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml
```

### Cloud Deployment with Terraform
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init

# Plan the deployment
terraform plan -var-file=prod.tfvars

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security best practices:

- Non-root containers
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Secret management with Kubernetes Secrets
- Network policies for service isolation
- Regular dependency updates
- Authentication and authorization

## Monitoring and Observability

The monitoring stack provides:

- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Application metrics (requests, latency, errors)
- Business metrics (orders, users, revenue)
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Alerting for critical issues

## CI/CD Pipelines

The CI/CD pipeline automates:

1. Code linting and static analysis
2. Unit and integration testing
3. Security scanning
4. Building and pushing Docker images
5. Deploying to development, staging, and production
6. Post-deployment testing and verification

## Best Practices

This implementation follows DevOps best practices:

- Infrastructure as Code for all resources
- Immutable infrastructure
- Automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring and observability
- Security by design
- Documentation and versioning
