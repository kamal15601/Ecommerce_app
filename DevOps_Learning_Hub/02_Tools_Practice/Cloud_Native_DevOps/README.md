## Introduction to Cloud-Native

Cloud-native technologies enable organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. These practices emphasize:

- **Containers**: Packaging software in isolated units
- **Microservices**: Building applications as collections of loosely coupled services
- **Declarative APIs**: Defining resources and behavior through clear APIs
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replacing rather than updating components

### Key Principles

1. **Design for resilience**: Systems should continue to work despite failures
2. **Implement automation**: From testing to deployment to scaling
3. **Use infrastructure as code**: Provision and manage through code
4. **Adopt continuous delivery**: Frequent, reliable software releases
5. **Monitor everything**: Comprehensive observability across the stack

## CNCF Landscape

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) hosts critical components of the cloud-native ecosystem:

### Core Projects

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Envoy**: Service proxy
- **Containerd**: Container runtime
- **Fluentd**: Unified logging layer
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing

### Project Categories

- **Orchestration & Management**
- **Runtime**
- **Application Definition & Development**
- **Observability & Analysis**
- **Platform**
- **Provisioning**
- **Security & Compliance**

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is a foundational approach for cloud-native applications.

### Key Concepts

- **Service Boundaries**: Defining domain-driven service boundaries
- **Data Management**: Patterns for data consistency across services
- **API Design**: RESTful and gRPC communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using events for service communication

### Implementation Patterns

- **API Gateway**: Managing client requests and routing
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamically locating service instances
- **Circuit Breaker**: Preventing cascading failures
- **Bulkhead**: Isolating failure domains
- **CQRS**: Separating read and write operations

## Containers and Orchestration

Containers provide consistency across environments and are the foundation of cloud-native applications.

### Container Technologies

- **Docker**: Building and running containers
- **Containerd**: Industry-standard container runtime
- **Podman**: Daemonless container engine
- **Buildah**: Building OCI container images

### Kubernetes Deep Dive

- **Control Plane Components**: API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager
- **Node Components**: Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime
- **Workload Resources**: Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Services, Ingress
- **Configuration & Secrets**: ConfigMaps, Secrets
- **Storage**: PersistentVolumes, StorageClasses
- **Scheduling & Eviction**: NodeSelectors, Taints, Tolerations
- **Security**: RBAC, NetworkPolicies, PodSecurityPolicies

## Service Mesh

Service meshes provide a dedicated infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication.

### Key Components

- **Control Plane**: Configuration and policy management
- **Data Plane**: Proxies that intercept traffic
- **Telemetry**: Traffic metrics and tracing
- **Security**: mTLS, authentication, authorization

### Service Mesh Implementations

- **Istio**: Comprehensive service mesh with advanced traffic management
- **Linkerd**: Lightweight, simple service mesh focused on performance
- **Consul Connect**: Service mesh with service discovery integration
- **Kuma**: Multi-platform service mesh built on Envoy

## Serverless Computing

Serverless allows developers to build applications without managing infrastructure.

### Serverless Platforms

- **AWS Lambda**: Event-driven compute service
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Event-driven serverless platform
- **Knative**: Kubernetes-based platform for serverless workloads

### Serverless Patterns

- **Function Composition**: Chaining functions for complex workflows
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Responding to system events
- **API Backends**: Building API endpoints with serverless functions
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Running functions on a schedule
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream processing with serverless

## Cloud-Native CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Delivery practices designed for cloud-native applications.

### CI/CD Pipeline Components

- **Source Control**: Git-based workflows
- **Build**: Container image creation and validation
- **Test**: Automated testing in containers
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment
- **Deployment**: Progressive delivery to environments

### CI/CD Tools for Cloud-Native

- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation in GitHub
- **Jenkins X**: Kubernetes-native CI/CD
- **Tekton**: Kubernetes-native pipeline execution
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous delivery tool
- **Spinnaker**: Multi-cloud continuous delivery platform
- **Flux**: GitOps operator for Kubernetes

## Observability in Cloud-Native

Monitoring, logging, and tracing in distributed systems.

### Three Pillars of Observability

- **Metrics**: Numerical data that provides system health
- **Logs**: Detailed event records
- **Traces**: Following requests through distributed systems

### Observability Stack

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Metrics visualization
- **Loki**: Log aggregation
- **Jaeger/OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and search
- **Kibana**: Log visualization

## GitOps Workflow

GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

### GitOps Principles

- **Declarative Configuration**: System state described declaratively
- **Version Controlled**: All changes tracked in Git
- **Automated Pull**: System pulls approved changes
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: Ensuring actual state matches desired state

### GitOps Tools

- **ArgoCD**: Application delivery and configuration management
- **Flux**: GitOps operator for Kubernetes
- **Kustomize**: Kubernetes configuration customization
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package management

## Hands-On Labs
