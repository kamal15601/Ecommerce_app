## Branching Strategies

### GitFlow

GitFlow is a branching model designed around project releases with defined development and release cycles.

**Core Branches:**
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Latest development code

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/*` - New features
- `release/*` - Release preparation
- `hotfix/*` - Production fixes
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes for upcoming releases

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Initialize GitFlow
git flow init

# Start a new feature
git flow feature start new-feature

# Finish the feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish new-feature

# Start a release
git flow release start v1.0.0

# Finish the release (merges to main and develop)
git flow release finish v1.0.0
```

### GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a simpler, lightweight workflow for teams that deploy frequently.

**Core Principles:**
1. The `main` branch is always deployable
2. Create branches from `main` for new work
3. Open pull requests early for discussion
4. Merge to `main` after review
5. Deploy immediately after merge

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Create a new branch from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Push changes and create PR
git push -u origin feature-branch

# After PR approval, merge and delete the branch
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d feature-branch
```

### Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-Based Development involves short-lived feature branches merged frequently to the main trunk.

**Key Practices:**
- Small, frequent commits to `main`
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Continuous integration on all commits
- Short-lived feature branches (1-2 days)

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Create a short-lived branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature-xyz

# Merge back to main frequently
git checkout main
git merge feature-xyz
git push
```

## Pull Request Workflows

### Creating Effective Pull Requests

**PR Title and Description:**
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Reference related issues (#123)
- Include a description of changes
- Add testing instructions
- List any dependencies

**Template Example:**
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Related Issues
Fixes #123
Addresses #456

## Testing
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Expected result

## Screenshots
[If applicable]

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CI checks pass
```

### Automated PR Checks

Configure GitHub repositories to require:

1. Status checks to pass before merging
2. Up-to-date branches before merging
3. Required number of approving reviews
4. Conversation resolution before merging

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Branches > Branch protection rules
3. Add rule for `main` branch
4. Enable required status checks, reviews, etc.

### PR Review Automation

Use GitHub Actions to automate PR processes:

```yaml
name: PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Check PR title format
        run: |
          if [[ ! "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" =~ ^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|chore): ]]; then
            echo "PR title must start with type (feat:, fix:, etc.)"
            exit 1
          fi
      - name: Check PR description length
        run: |
          if [[ $(echo "${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}" | wc -w) -lt 10 ]]; then
            echo "PR description too short. Please provide more details."
            exit 1
          fi
```

## Code Review Best Practices

### Review Guidelines

**What to look for:**
- **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Design**: Is the solution well-designed?
- **Complexity**: Is the code simple enough to understand?
- **Tests**: Are there appropriate tests?
- **Naming**: Are variables, functions, and classes named clearly?
- **Comments**: Are comments clear and useful where needed?
- **Style**: Does the code follow project conventions?
- **Documentation**: Are docs updated to reflect changes?

### Effective Review Comments

**Good Review Comments:**
- Specific and actionable
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Include code examples when helpful
- Use a constructive, collaborative tone
- Distinguish between required and suggested changes

**Examples:**

Poor: "This function is too complex."

Better: "The calculateTotal() function is doing too many things at once. Consider extracting the discount calculation into a separate function to improve readability and testability."

### Review Workflow

**Reviewer's Process:**
1. Understand the context and purpose
2. First pass: big-picture review
3. Second pass: detailed code review
4. Test the changes if possible
5. Provide timely feedback
6. Re-review after changes

**Author's Process:**
1. Address all comments
2. Explain changes or why feedback wasn't implemented
3. Request re-review when ready

## GitHub Issue Management

### Issue Templates

Create templates for different issue types:

```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml
name: Bug Report
description: File a bug report
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
  - type: input
    id: version
    attributes:
      label: Version
      description: What version are you using?
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: what-happened
    attributes:
      label: What happened?
      description: Also tell us, what did you expect to happen?
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: reproduction
    attributes:
      label: Steps to reproduce
      description: How can we reproduce this issue?
    validations:
      required: true
```

### Issue Labels

Implement a consistent labeling system:

- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `question`
- **Priority**: `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`
- **Status**: `needs-triage`, `in-progress`, `needs-review`
- **Effort**: `effort-small`, `effort-medium`, `effort-large`
- **Component**: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `api`

### Issue Automation

Automatically manage issues with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Issue Management
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.addLabels({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              labels: ['needs-triage']
            })
```

## GitHub Project Management

### Project Boards

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Go to repository or organization Projects
2. Create a new project using the board template
3. Add columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`
4. Configure automation

**Automation Rules:**
- Move newly added issues to `To Do`
- Move issues with PRs to `In Progress`
- Move closed issues to `Done`

### Milestone Planning

Use milestones to group issues for releases:

1. Create milestone with target date
2. Add relevant issues to milestone
3. Track progress on the milestone page

### Release Management

**Creating Releases:**
1. Draft a new release from the Releases page
2. Select the tag or create a new one
3. Fill out the release title and notes
4. Attach any binaries/artifacts
5. Publish or save as draft

**Automated Release Notes:**
```yaml
name: Release Drafter
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  draft_release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## GitHub Security Features

### Dependency Management

**Dependabot Configuration:**
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Security Scanning

Enable GitHub's code scanning with CodeQL:

```yaml
name: "Code Scanning"
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * 0'
jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: ['javascript', 'python']
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

### Secret Management

Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information:

1. Go to repository Settings > Secrets
2. Add secrets for API keys, tokens, etc.
3. Reference in workflows:
```yaml
${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

## GitHub Actions

### CI/CD Workflows

**Example for a Node.js application:**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build_and_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
  
  deploy:
    needs: build_and_test
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment steps here
```

### Matrix Builds

Test across multiple configurations:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

### Reusable Workflows

Create shared workflows:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable.yml
name: Reusable Build Workflow
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

Call from another workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
    with:
      node-version: '16'
```

## GitHub Packages

### Publishing Packages

**Publish an npm package:**
```yaml
name: Publish Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  build-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
          scope: '@your-org'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Publish a Docker image:**
```yaml
name: Publish Docker image
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
```

### Consuming Packages

**.npmrc for GitHub Packages:**
```
@your-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

**Dockerfile with GitHub Packages:**
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/your-org/base-image:latest
# Rest of your Dockerfile
```

## GitHub API and Webhooks

### GitHub API Examples

**Fetch repository information:**
```javascript
const { Octokit } = require("@octokit/rest");
const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });

async function getRepoInfo() {
  const { data } = await octokit.repos.get({
    owner: "your-org",
    repo: "your-repo",
  });
  console.log(data);
}
```

**Create an issue:**
```javascript
await octokit.issues.create({
  owner: "your-org",
  repo: "your-repo",
  title: "Found a bug",
  body: "This is a bug report",
  labels: ["bug"],
});
```

### Setting Up Webhooks

1. Go to repository Settings > Webhooks
2. Add webhook
   - Payload URL: Your server endpoint
   - Content type: application/json
   - Secret: Generate a secure secret
   - Choose events to trigger the webhook

**Webhook Handler Example:**
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-hub-signature-256'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const secret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const digest = 'sha256=' + hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');
  
  if (signature === digest) {
    console.log('Valid webhook received');
    
    // Handle different event types
    const event = req.headers['x-github-event'];
    if (event === 'push') {
      // Handle push event
    } else if (event === 'pull_request') {
      // Handle PR event
    }
    
    res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
  } else {
    console.log('Invalid webhook');
    res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
});
```
